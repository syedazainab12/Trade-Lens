# Trade-Lens
 Currently, parties involved in a trade have to place a lot of trust in each other. This is because there is no way to pinpoint where exactly any problems (such as late delivery or deteriorated condition) occurred. The Trade Lens Dapp will solve this problem by providing a central trade lens system. This system will use blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent record of all trade transactions. This will make it easier to identify problems and hold parties accountable
